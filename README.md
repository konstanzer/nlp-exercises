Natural language processing (NLP) has two categories for our purposes.
**Text Classification**: Assign tags or categories to text according to its content (sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.)
**Topic Modeling**: Discover the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a commonly used algorithm. The topics are defined as part of generating the topic models.
